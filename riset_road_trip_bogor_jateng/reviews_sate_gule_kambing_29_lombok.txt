I really like eating here...every time I stop by Lombok Alley, I always buy the gule...the meat is tender, the spices are good, the seller is friendly...

Ordered goat satay and goat gule here because it happened to be close by and saw that the ratings were good. It turns out the goat gule was far below expectations. The meat is tender but the sauce doesn't taste like gule spices, it's too runny like too much water. The price of sugar is 50 thousand. As for the goat satay, it actually still tastes ok but unfortunately the satay is dirty on the skewers and there's still blood on it. HUHUHU I'm crying so much, I immediately don't feel like eating. The price of satay is also expensive, 100 thousand. I'm really disappointed. I don't think it's worth it.
