Normal as Budget Hotel
Breakfast is okay, taste okay but less attendant. Perhaps this because of Festive.

The location is quite good, near to everything but not near in walking distance.

There's a great coffee shop beside this hotel.

The staff is nice.

The room is in good condition, clean and tidy, the air conditioner works very well.
The wifi works well.

There's good variety in the breakfast menu. Warm hospitality of the staff. Room is rather small. AC, warm water and wifi provided. Do bring your own toothbrush/toothpaste as it is not provided.

Review by Devi Devi (1 star, 3 years ago):
I booked this hotel on the way back to Jakarta from Surabaya, I planned to stay for around 8-9 hours and will continue drive back early in the morning so I do not need a fancy room.
The receptionist was friendly and they response quickly.
I understood this is a budget hotel with 1 or 2 stars, but I can not handle what I found in the bed (refer to the picture). The housekeeping came quickly with the new bed sheet but overall cleanliness was 1/5. Decided to check out after 15 minutes experiencing the room
