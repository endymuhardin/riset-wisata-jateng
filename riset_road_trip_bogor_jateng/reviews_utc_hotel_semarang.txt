It's ok to be a resting place but not comfortable enough. Need a lot of renovation. The room quite damp

Underrated hotel btw. I thought this place was not good, because located far from downtown. But it compensation by quite and nice area. Has huge place of parking lot, casue it has ball room for an event such as graduation, wedding. And you must try coffee shop there.

Close to the conference hall so I intentionally transit here. The room is simple, quite clean. The service is very good.

I have not stay in this hotel. But i have visited this hotel once. The service is good, the hall room is also nice and big. And may be one comment is the front look of the hotel that need to be renew because it look too old.
