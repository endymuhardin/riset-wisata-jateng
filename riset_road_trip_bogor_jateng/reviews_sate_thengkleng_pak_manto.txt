Review by Martin Nugroho (4 stars, 2 months ago):
I visited this restaurant some years ago. When it was still a side street food stall. Pak Manto himself was the cook. Now the restaurant is bigger and managed professionally. As far as I remember the taste has not changed. In terms of the price, it has increased a lot. But in my opinion it is still worth it. Buntel masak is still my favourite. I would rate the food 4 out of 5.

alhamdulillah they taste delicious. not too fatty though (I actually like it fattier). I ordered buntel satay mixed for take away. it is same price as one package of sate buntel (contains 3 satays), so I think it is a downside because 3 original satays are not comparable with 1 buntel satay.

One of the well known restaurant to have lamb satay and soup! They have many types of food, made from lamb. The friend rice is really underrated, it's one if the must try item. The tongseng has a strong taste, it's one of their most favorite menu. They have toilet and praying room in the back of the building.

food was incredible. big portion with a high prices but it all worth it by delicious taste. bad thing is about the rice, very hard and cold served.
