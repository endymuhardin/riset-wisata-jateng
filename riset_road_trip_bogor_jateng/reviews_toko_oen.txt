Walking into Toko Oen is like stepping into an old photograph. It’s a certified tourist magnet, and yeah, on weekends it’s packed. If you’re chasing culinary innovation, keep moving - this place is about nostalgia.

I went in with mid expectation, and that’s probably the only reason I left mildly satisfied. The poffertjes? Decent. Buttery, sweet, comes with three scoops of ice cream, though I hoped for more burnt edges to contrast all that creamy softness. Bitterballen were crispy, seasoned right, and filled generously, though what looked like honey mustard dip tasted more like sweetened mayo. The star of the show, Bistik Lidah, delivered: tender, and dripping with that weirdly sweet comforting Javanese-Dutch sauce fusion. It’s like beef tongue dressed in a tuxedo but wearing blangkon.

But then, the smoke show. Literally.

An old stinky guy started smoking right next to us despite the no smoking signs from every wall. I had my little daughter with me, so we asked the staff to intervene. They actually looked uncomfortable & afraid to confront the dude. We tried ourselves (politely) & got scolded for our trouble. Second waiter? Same story. Their grand solution? We should move to other table. Not the guy breaking the rules. Us.

Here’s the thing: we were actually spending more money than the frog looking gremlin who just ordered a drink. From any business angle, that math doesn’t check out. So we walked. And next time we’re in Semarang, we’ll let this antique stay exactly where it belongs: in the past.

It's my first time with my family here. The vibe was classic, tbh I like the outfit of their staff (all dressed in white uniform), no complaint with the dishes but to me the poffertjes & ice cream was the champ!!!

A legendary restaurant that must be visited when traveling to the city of Semarang. Toko Oen serves Indonesian-Dutch fusion culinary delights with authentic taste. My favorites are Poffertjes and Rum Raisin ice cream. This shop offers nostalgia and western culinary delights that will make you miss the vintage vibes of Semarang city.

Almost forgot to snap a pic of my food 🫣 (blame the “bistik lidah sapi”—it was so good I nearly ate it all!). Trust me, that dish is a flavor bomb 💣. My kid’s spaghetti was a hit too!

Stopped by during lunch rush, and the service was super quick ⚡. Loved the vibe here—colonial-era decor, old-school charm… felt like stepping into a time machine 🌿🏛️.

Great spot for a tasty, no-fuss meal! 👌

Toko Oen shines when it comes to Christmas decor—the festive atmosphere is truly captivating and perfect for the season. The vintage charm and holiday decorations make it an Instagram-worthy spot. However, beyond the ambiance, the experience didn’t live up to the hype.

The food was average at best. While the ice cream was the highlight—smooth and flavorful—the croissant was soggy and bland, and the apple pie lacked the richness and taste I expected. For a place with such a reputation, the food fell short of expectations.

Service was also disappointing. The staff seemed unprepared and couldn’t clearly explain the menu when asked, which made ordering a frustrating experience. It felt like the place was coasting on its history and ambiance rather than delivering a well-rounded dining experience.

Overall, Toko Oen feels overrated. Visit for the decor and nostalgia, but temper your expectations when it comes to the food and service.
