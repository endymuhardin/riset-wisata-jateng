Legendary Nasi Liwet in Solo. The taste is authentic and delicious. The portion is quite big. The price is reasonable. The place is clean and comfortable. The service is fast and friendly. Highly recommended.

Review by Dewi Lestari (4 stars, 6 months ago):
Good nasi liwet, but a bit too sweet for my taste. The chicken is tender and the portion is generous. The price is affordable. The place is a bit crowded, especially during peak hours.
