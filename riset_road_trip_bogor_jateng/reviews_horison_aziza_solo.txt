We recently stayed at Horison Aziza Solo for two nights and had a pleasant experience. The hotel is strategically located in the heart of Solo, making it easy to explore nearby attractions like the traditional markets and historical sites. The rooms were clean and comfortable, with modern amenities that made our stay enjoyable.

The staff were friendly and attentive, always ready to assist with any requests. We particularly enjoyed the breakfast buffet, which offered a good variety of local and international dishes. The hotelâ€™s facilities, including the swimming pool and business center, were well-maintained and added to the overall convenience.

One minor downside was the limited parking space, but it didnâ€™t significantly impact our stay. Overall, Horison Aziza Solo is a great choice for both business and leisure travelers looking for a comfortable and convenient stay in Solo.

The location is right next to the largest batik market and traditional market, the Pasar Gedhe. The room is basic. My one complaint is the AC took long to be cool. The breakfast is decent tho.
