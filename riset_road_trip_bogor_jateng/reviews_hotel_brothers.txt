Review by Handi (4 stars, a year ago):
Place very good very near to super market. Room very good clean and the air conditioning is very cold. The bad side near main road, some times the car sound and other activities on the street, you can hear it in your room. Owh the hotel is also under staff so ya, better do it yourself.

Review by Medi (3 stars, a year ago):
I booked twin deluxe room. The room is big and clean enough. But I suggest to emphasize more on the maintenance. for instance at that time, there is no tissue paper, only toilet paper and the electric kettle can not be opened and I asked to replace and no teaspoon.

A very good Hotel

This Hotel is excellent. For a price is a very good deal.
The staff are welcome. Again it is a no nonsense Hotel the room is clean facility is OK. Room Amenities is not moderate but it is a reasonable priced Hotel, so I couldn't complain much.

The location is good. It is surrounded by a lot of fast food chains. But it you would like to taste local cuisine.
At night, there is a hawker surrounded the hotel.

Review by godwin rozario (4 stars, 6 years ago):
One of the most underrated hotels. The rooms are nice and spacious and quite clean, bathroom is also quite spacious. Very moderately priced, in fact in comparison to what a hotel like ibis or Harris offer for their size of rooms, this is a really good place in terms of value for money. Just 2 drawbacks about the hotel, the food menu for the room service is really very small and restricted. And the second the bed linen is always stained or dirty and you need to always request house keeping for a change. If these 2 issues get fixed, will be a great place to stay. Located in solo baru.
