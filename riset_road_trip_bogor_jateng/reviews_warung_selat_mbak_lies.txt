Authentic Selat Solo. The taste is delicious and the portion is generous. The price is very affordable. The place is simple but clean. Highly recommended for trying Selat Solo.

Review by Siti Aminah (4 stars, 8 months ago):
Good Selat Solo, but the place is a bit crowded during lunch time. The service is fast. The taste is good, not too sweet.

One of the best Selat Solo in town. The taste is consistent and delicious. The price is cheap. The place is always full of customers. Must try when in Solo.
